          shut it down, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply suspend
          the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again, run
          `vagrant up`.

        non_nat_adapter_zero: |-
          The VMware adapter currently requires the first network
          adapter to be a NAT device. This limitation may be removed in a

        base_address_invalid: |-
          The IP address provided for `base_address` is invalid.
        base_mac_invalid: |-
          The MAC address provided for `base_mac` is invalid. Ensure the MAC
          address provided is valid and try starting the guest again.
        base_address_without_mac: |-
          The `base_mac` option must be configured when the
          `base_address` option is set.
        synced_folder_id_invalid: |-
          VMware requires a shared folder ID made up of characters,
          numbers, hyphens, and underscores. By default, Vagrant sets the
          ID of shared folders to the guest path. This is incompatible with
          VMware. Please override the Vagrant default by either setting
          the `:id` option on your synced folder definition, or setting
          the `:vmware__id` option if you want only VMware to see this setting.

      errors:
        box_vmx_file_not_found: |-
          A "vmx" file was not found in the box specified. A "vmx" file is
          required to clone, boot, and manage VMware machines. Please report
          this issue to the maintainer of the box you're using, as this is
          an issue with the creation of the box itself.
        base_address_range: |-
          The address provided for `base_address` is not within the allowed range
          of DHCP addresses. Please update the configured address to be within the
          allowed range:

        cannot_get_ssh_info: |-
          There was a problem retrieving the SSH info from the guest. There are
          a variety of root issues that can cause this. If this error continues
          to occur across several attempts, it may indicate a problem with the
          base box being used. If this error occurs across multiple boxes, it
          may indicate a VMware configuration problem. Persistent problems can
          be reported to:

            https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant-vmware-desktop/issues
        clone_folder_exists: |-
          The clone folder that Vagrant is attempting to use to import
          the VMware box has existed repeatedly 10 times while generating
          random filenames. This is not sane behavior of your system. Please
          restart your computer and try again as an attempt to add entropy
          to your system.
        clone_folder_not_folder: |-
          The clone directory given is not a directory. This is an internal
          error and should be reported as a bug to:

          Path: %{path}
        disk_not_created: Disk %{name} not created!
        disk_not_resized_snapshot: |-
          Disk not resized because snapshots are present! Vagrant can
          not resize a disk if snapshots exist for a VM. If you wish to resize
          disk please remove snapshots associated with the VM.

          Path: %{path}
        destroy_invalid_state: |-
          The VMware machine cannot be destroyed beacuse it is still
          running. Please make sure the machine is properly halted before
          attempting to delete.

          The VMware VM could not be cloned due to permission errors!
          Please verify that the destination directory can be read and written
          to. The destination directory is printed below:

          %{destination}
        driver_dhcp_leases_read_perms: |-
          Vagrant couldn't read the VMware DHCP leases file due to permissions
          issues! Please make sure that the file below has sufficient read
          permissions so that the user running Vagrant can read it.

          %{path}
        driver_invalid_response: |-
          The Vagrant VMware Utility provided an unexpected response. Please
          run the command again.
        driver_missing_dhcp_leases_file: |-
          The DHCP leases file for the vmnet device '%{device}' could
          not be found. Vagrant requires this file to find the IP address
          given by DHCP to your machine. Please report this as a bug along
          with log output.
        driver_missing_fp_nat_conf: |-
          The nat configuration file for the vmnet device '%{device}' is
          missing. Verify that the VMware device '%{device}' is a NAT
          device.
        driver_missing_networking_file: |-
          The file containing the list of VMware networking devices could
          not be found. Networks can not be setup. Please report this as a bug.
        driver_missing_service_starter: |-
          The binary to start VMware services could not be found. This
          is required in order to modify networking files. This can be caused
          by a broken Fusion installation or an invalid Fusion version.
          Please report a bug.
        driver_missing_vmnet_cli: |-
          The `vmnet-cli` binary could not be found. VMware %{product} typically
          ships with this binary which is required to control the network
          devices. Vagrant could not find it. Please report this as a bug!
        driver_missing_vmx: |-
          The VMware %{product} driver was started with a path to a VM that
          doesn't exist.

          Path: %{vm_dir}
        driver_missing_vmx_cli: |-
          The "vmware-vmx" application could not be found. The VMware
          provider is responsible for finding this application. Please
          report a bug with debug output attached (by setting VAGRANT_LOG to
          "debug").
        driver_networking_file_not_found: |-
          The file which defines networking interfaces for VMware %{product}
          could not be found. Please verify %{product} is installed properly
          and try again. If this problem persists, please contact
          support.
        driver_networking_file_bad_permissions: |-
          A file that the Vagrant VMware %{product} provider must modify has
          bad permissions. Please make sure that the user running Vagrant can
          read the following file:

          %{path}
        driver_read_version_failed: |-
          The VMware %{product} provider failed to determine the version of
          VMware %{product} installed. This is often indicative of other
          errors in the installation of VMware %{product}. The error
          output from attempting to determine the version is shown below,
          in case it helps point out the issue.

          %{output}
        driver_vmnet_configure_failed: |-
          Vagrant failed to configure the VMware network interfaces! The
          output of the failed command, if any, is below.

          %{output}
        driver_vmnet_start_failed: |-
          Vagrant failed to start the VMware network interfaces! The output
          of the failed command, if any, is below. The usual cause for this
          is invalid configuration of the VMware network components. If
          the problem persists, please contact support.

          %{output}
        driver_vmnet_stop_failed: |-
          Vagrant failed to stop the VMware network interfaces! The output
          of the failed command, if any, is below.

          %{output}
        feature_not_supported: |-
          Vagrant is unable to perform the requested action due to limitations
          imposed by the current VMware %{product} license in use. To successfully
          perform the requested action, the VMware %{product} license must be
          upgraded from a standard license to a professional license.
        forwarded_ports_collide_with_existing_nat: |-
          Some of the defined forwarded ports would collide with existing
          forwarded ports on VMware network devices. This can be due to
          existing Vagrant-managed VMware machines, or due to manually
          configured port forwarding with VMware. Please fix the following
          port collisions and try again:

          %{ports}
        forwarded_port_no_guest_ip: |-
          The IP of the guest VM could not be detected for setting up
          forwarded ports. This is not common. However, a destroying the VM
          and recreating it usually fixes this. Please run `vagrant destroy`
          then `vagrant up`. Alternatively, a `vagrant reload` sometimes
          fixes this.
        fusion_upgrade_required: |-
          You're using a license that doesn't allow you to use the installed
          version of Fusion. This error message occurs if you upgraded Fusion
          without also upgrading your license. Please upgrade your license to
          unlock features and support for the latest version of VMware Fusion,
          or revert your version of Fusion back to the supported version.
          You can upgrade your license by going to the following URL:

          http://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware

        guest_missing_hgfs: |-
          HGFS was never found on the running virtual machine. This must be
          installed either through VMware tools or Open VM Tools. HGFS is
          required for shared folders to work properly. Please install either
          the VMware tools or Open VM Tools and try again.
        hc_license: |-
          Your HashiCorp license doesn't work with '%{product}'. Please verify
          you purchased the correct license. If you have any problems, please
          contact support at support@hashicorp.com.
        helper_failed: |-
          %{output}
        helper_install_failed: |-
          Installing the Vagrant VMware sudo helper has failed. In order to
          install the sudo helper, Vagrant must chown the helper as root
          and enable setuid on the binary. The most common cause of this error
          is that the filesystem that the Vagrant home directory folder is in
          doesn't support setuid.

          Please check for this, fix any issues, and run Vagrant to try again
          If this problem persists, please contact support.
        helper_invalid_command: |-
          Invalid command to Vagrant VMware helper: %{command}
        helper_not_root: |-
          The Vagrant VMware helper must be run as root.
        helper_requires_command: |-
          The Vagrant VMware sudo helper requires a command.
        helper_requires_data_file: |-
          The Vagrant VMware sudo helper requires a valid data
          file to be passed to it.
        helper_requires_reinstall: |-
          Vagrant has detected that the VMware plugin is not properly setup.
          Please reinstall the VMware plugin and run this command again. If
          this error persists please contact support.
        helper_wrapper_missing: |-
          The Vagrant VMware sudo helper wrapper is missing. This
          installation of the VMware provider is broken. Please uninstall
          and reinstall.
        linux_mount_gid_failed: |-
          Vagrant failed to determine group ID for synced folder path. This
          can be fixed by manually defining the group ID within the Vagrantfile.

            Synced Folder: %{folder_name}
        linux_mount_uid_failed: |-
          Vagrant failed to determine user ID for synced folder path. This
          can be fixed by manually defining the user ID within the Vagrantfile.

            Synced Folder: %{folder_name}
        linux_service_init_script_missing: |-
          The init script for managing VMware services could not be found.
          Vagrant needs this script in order to verify that VMware is properly
          running and also to attempt to start services if they're not.
          Please verify VMware is properly installed and try again. If
          the problem persists, please contact support.
        missing_nat_device: |-
          Failed to locate the VMware NAT device. Please validate your VMware
          network settings and try again.
        networking_file_missing_version: |-
          The VMware network devices file is missing the "VERSION"
          field. The Vagrant provider for can not safely modify
          this file without knowing the version. Please verify your
          copy of VMware is installed properly.
        networking_file_unsupported_version: |-
          The VMware network devices file is reporting a version
          that Vagrant cannot understand. Vagrant requires the "1,0" version
          for this file. Reported version: %{reported_version}

          Please contact support for more information.
        networking_host_only_collision: |-
          The host only network with the IP '%{ip}' would collide with
          another device '%{device}'. This means that VMware cannot create
          a proper networking device to route to your VM. Please choose
          another IP or shut down the existing device.
        networking_no_slots_for_high_level: |-
          There is no available slots on the VMware VM for the configured
          high-level network interfaces. "private_network" and "public_network"
          network configurations consume a single network adapter slot on the
          virtual machine. VMware limits the number of slots to 8, and it
          appears that every slot is in use. Please lower the number of used
          network adapters.
        nfs_no_network: |-
          NFS requires a static IP to be configured. Please configure
          a private network with a static IP.
        package_not_supported: |-
          The "package" command is not supported with VMware. We recommend
          taking a look at Packer (www.packer.io) as an option for creating
          VMware images.
        port_forward_invalid_protocol: |-
          An invalid protocol type has been provided for a port forward
          configuration. Vagrant supports port forwarding protocols values:

            * udp
            * tcp

          Please update your port forward configuration and run the command
          again. Below is the invalid port forward entry:

            Guest IP:   %{guest_ip}
            Guest Port: %{guest_port}
            Host Port:  %{host_port}
            Protocol:   %{protocol}
        routing_table_command_not_found: |-
          The external program used to read TCP/IP routing tables in order
          to protect you against creating network collisions could not be
          found. On Linux and Mac OS X, this is `netstat`. Please make sure
          this is on your PATH. It is generally installed with your
          operating system.
        routing_table_load_error: |-
          Failed to load the TCP/IP routing tables for your computer! Vagrant
          does this in order to verify you're not creating a network that
          collides with any others. The error is reported below:

          %{output}
        routing_table_unsupported_os: |-
          Vagrant can't read the routing tables on this operating system.
          Vagrant must be able to do this in order to check for network
          collisions in order to ensure a good Vagrant experience. Please
          report a bug.
        shared_folder_symlink_failed: |-
          There was an error attempting to symlink your shared folders into
          place. If you don't want to symlink your shared folders (and keep
          them into the default place), set the `:vmware__symlink` option to
          `false` on the synced folders.
        single_machine_lock: |-
          Another instance of Vagrant is running operations on the same
          virtual machine. The VMware provider for Vagrant limits
          operations on one machine to be done by only one process at a time.
          Note however that you can run multiple commands against different
          virtual machines in parallel.
        start_timeout: |-
          Vagrant timed out while trying to start the VMware machine. This
          error is caused by VMware never successfully starting the machine.
          This can often be fixed by simply retrying. If the error persists,
          please verify that VMware is functional. This is not a Vagrant
          issue.
        utility_upgrade_required: |-
          The currently running version of the Vagrant VMware utility is not
          supported by this version of the Vagrant VMware desktop plugin.
          Please install a supported version of the Vagrant VMware Utility
          and run the command again.

            Utility version:             %{utility_version}
            Utility version requirement: %{utility_requirement}

        vmnet_device_create_failed: |-
          Vagrant failed to create a new vmnet device for your configured
          network settings! Please verify Workstation is working properly
          and try again. Please contact support if the problem persists.
        vmnet_device_route_conflict: |-
          The VMware network device '%{device}' can't be started because
          its routes collide with another device: '%{route_device}'. Please
          either fix the settings of the VMware network device or stop the
          colliding device. Your machine can't be started while VMware
          networking is broken.

          Routing to the IP '%{ip}' should route through '%{device}', but
          instead routes through '%{route_device}'.
        vmnet_devices_wont_start: |-
          The VMware "vmnet" devices are failing to start. The most common
          reason for this is collisions with existing network services. For
          example, if a hostonly network space collides with another hostonly
          network (such as with VirtualBox), it will fail to start. Likewise,
          if forwarded ports collide with other listening ports, it will
          fail to start.

          Vagrant does its best to fix these issues, but in some cases it
          cannot determine the root cause of these failures.

          Please verify you have no other colliding network services running.
          As a last resort, restarting your computer often fixes this issue.
        vmnet_slots_full: |-
          VMware Workstation on Windows limits the total number of vmnet
          devices to 9. You have passed this point. Please open the virtual
          network editor and remove some unneeded networks.
        vmnet_no_ipv6: |-
          The VMware product does not support IPv6 in a robust way like other
          Vagrant providers. This is not a bug in Vagrant - the upstream
          provider does not provide robust support for IPv6.
        vmcancel_error: |-
          An error occurred causing VMware to cancel the current operation. Details
          of the error causing the cancelation:

          %{error}

          The full log can be located at:

          %{vmware_log_path}
        vmexec_error: |-
          An error occurred while executing `%{executable}`, a utility for controlling
          VMware machines. The command and output are below:

          Command: %{command}

          Stdout: %{stdout}

          Stderr: %{stderr}
        vmrun_error: |-
          An error occurred while executing `vmrun`, a utility for controlling
          VMware machines. The command and output are below:

          Command: %{command}

          Stdout: %{stdout}

          Stderr: %{stderr}
        vmrun_not_found: |-
          The `vmrun` binary could not be found. This is normally packaged
          with VMware. Please verify that VMware is properly installed
          and try again.
        vmware_linux_service_wont_start: |-
          The VMware Linux services aren't running. Vagrant attempted to
          start them for you but they wouldn't come up properly. Please verify
          VMware is properly installed and that the services will start. The
          services are usually exposed as a standard init script. If you just
          installed VMware, you may need to reboot your system so the kernel
          extensions are properly built and installed.
        vnetlib_error: |-
          An error occurred while modifying VMware network devices. The
          command and output are shown below.

          Command: %{command}

          Stdout: %{stdout}

          Stderr: %{stderr}
        vnetlib_not_found: |-
          The "vnetlib" utility could not be found. Vagrant uses this to
          programmatically manage VMware network devices on Windows. This utility
          installs with VMware Workstation. Please verify that Workstation is
          properly installed and try again.
        workstation_upgrade_required: |-
          You're using a license that doesn't allow you to use the installed
          version of Workstation. This error message occurs if you upgraded Workstation
          without also upgrading your license. Please upgrade your license to
          unlock features and support for the latest version of VMware Workstation,
          or revert your version of Workstation back to the supported version.
          You can upgrade your license by going to the following URL:
